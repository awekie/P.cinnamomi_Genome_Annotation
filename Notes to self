Conda enviroment does not have setuptools ect
"Raw script" based programs can be called to run everywhere by making a custom PATHVARIABLE and added it to the .bashrc file,> PATHVARIABLE/program
PROGRAMSCRIPT = export path/to/program (?)

.py = python script file, 
python setup.py install (from with program directory ,
might not work because of sudo, specify that you only want to install it in your portion of the RCC
python setup.py install --prefix /home/aec77/.local 

^^ This seems to work best when compiling from binaries, involves accessing C: from WSL and using rsync to push .tar(?).gz to the RCC
- dont assume setup.py is the correct install method 

cactus is install in Conda enviro
cactus requires the creation of a 'seqfile'

edit - EOL for creating txt files to run on RCC

RAGTAG in inside conda enviro2
post ragtag correction and scaffolding there will be more contigs and a different genome length (with extra Ns because of alignment mapping). New contig heads will contain "+"s 
to remove these use
cat old.fasta | sed 's/\+(OR OTHER REGEX)/(REPLACEMENT)/g' > new.fasta

1.  Create a directory in the **mnt** folder `mkdir /mnt/d`
2.  Mount the external drive to the directory you just created in the mnt folder (assume the drive shows in Windows as "D:") `mount -t drvfs d: /mnt/d`
**If you need administration privileges use sudo in front of both commands**

#Checking genome length
cat file.fa | awk '$0 ~ ">" {if (NR > 1) {print c;} c=0;printf substr($0,2,100) "\t"; } $0 !~ ">" {c+=length($0);} END { print c; }' > tabbed_file.txt
$ cat tabbed_file.txt | awk '{ sum+=$2} END {print sum}'
