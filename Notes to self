Conda enviroment does not have setuptools ect
"Raw script" based programs can be called to run everywhere by making a custom PATHVARIABLE and added it to the .bashrc file,> PATHVARIABLE/program
PROGRAMSCRIPT = export path/to/program (?)

.py = python script file, 
python setup.py install (from with program directory ,
might not work because of sudo, specify that you only want to install it in your portion of the RCC
python setup.py install --prefix /home/aec77/.local 

^^ This seems to work best when compiling from binaries, involves accessing C: from WSL and using rsync to push .tar(?).gz to the RCC
- dont assume setup.py is the correct install method 

cactus is install in Conda enviro
